        <h2>What is ShareBin?</h2>
        <p>ShareBin is an anonymous file hosting platform that allows users to upload and share files without requiring an account or any personal information. It's a simple and convenient way to share files with friends, colleagues, or anyone else.</p>
        <h2>Who created ShareBin?</h2>
        <p>ShareBin was created by UnusefulCoder, a developer who loves building simple and useful tools that make people's lives easier. You can find the source code for this project on <a href="https://github.com/InsufiKoder/file-sharing-server">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <h2>How does ShareBin work?</h2>
        <p>When you upload a file to ShareBin, it gets stored on the server and assigned a unique URL. You can then share this URL with anyone you want to share the file with. When someone accesses the URL, they can download the file directly from the server.</p>

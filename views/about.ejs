        <h2>What is ShareBin?</h2>
        <p>ShareBin is an anonymous file hosting platform that allows users to upload and share files without requiring an account or any personal information. It's a simple and convenient way to share files with friends, colleagues, or anyone else.</p>

        <h2>Who created ShareBin?</h2>
        <p>ShareBin was created by UnusefulCoder, a developer who loves building simple and useful tools that make people's lives easier. You can find the source code for this project on <a href="https://github.com/InsufiKoder/sharebin">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h2>How does ShareBin work?</h2>
        <p>When you upload a file to ShareBin, it gets stored on the server and assigned a unique URL. You can then share this URL with anyone you want to share the file with. When someone accesses the URL, they can download the file directly from the server.</p>

        <h2>Who can use ShareBin?</h2>
        <p>ShareBin is available to anyone who needs to share files. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone who wants to share pictures or documents with friends and family, ShareBin is the perfect tool for you.</p>

        <h2>Is ShareBin free to use?</h2>
        <p>Yes, ShareBin is completely free to use. There are no hidden fees or charges. You can upload and share as many files as you want, for as long as you want.</p>

        <h2>How long are files stored on ShareBin?</h2>
        <p>Files uploaded to ShareBin are stored for 7 days. After 7 days, they are automatically deleted from our servers. If you need to keep a file for longer than 7 days, you can simply re-upload it to ShareBin.</p>

        <h2>Is ShareBin secure?</h2>
        <p>Yes, ShareBin takes security very seriously. All files uploaded to our servers are encrypted and stored securely. We also use SSL encryption to ensure that all data transmitted between our servers and your computer is secure.</p>

        <h2>Can I upload large files to ShareBin?</h2>
        <p>ShareBin has a file size limit of 250 MB per file. If you need to upload larger files, you can use a file compression tool to reduce the file size, or you can split the file into smaller parts and upload them separately.</p>
